Project Name: Digital Economics Library
Introduction: The inspiration for the Digital Economics Library stemmed from my passion for economics and the need for a centralized resource where students and enthusiasts could access vital literature and research articles. Throughout my studies, I often found it challenging to locate quality resources, and I wanted to create a solution that would ease this process for others.
The idea began in Aout 2024, during the ALX SE program, where we were encouraged to create portfolio projects that would showcase our skills. I envisioned a digital library that would not only compile important works but also facilitate easier access to materials for students in economics. After several weeks of planning and development, I am proud to present this project as a culmination of my learning journey.
This project serves as my portfolio piece for ALX SE program, highlighting my abilities in web development and project management. You can learn more about the program
